Pixel art Maker Project/udacity
In this project I demonstrated my ability to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together to complete a project. 

This is the first javaScript project i completed through the udacity Front-End developer nanodegree.
The purpose of this app is to allow users to creat grids and style them based on their input values.
